# What and Why
This repos contains some arbitrary `HTML` e-mail templates I created during
my journey of learning and using `HTML` e-mail based on Gmail client.

Sometimes I need to send a newsletter with a fancy appearance (or layout).
Sometimes I simply need to try out some ideas and the limits that different
e-mail clients allow for.

# Pure to some degree
~~The `HTML` files here are pure only in the sense that no external `CSS` files
are linked to them. In other words, they all use the `<style>` tag to employ
`inline CSS`.~~

~~`<tr>` and `<td>` are heavily relied on since `<table>` seems to be the only
choice left to me to create a well-structured layout.~~
